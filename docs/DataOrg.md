# Organization of Data files (SQL tables)

_All will have a creation timestamp_

##  ➡️ Actual [SQL Table config](SQL_Tables.md)

## user table (for login)

## Patron
* id / key
* first name
* last name
* address
* city
* province
* phone
* email (optional)

## LibraryCard
* key is barcode:  2xxxxyyyyy : x will be library code (0748) y is sequential number (99,999 cards only)
* patron id (required, liked to Patron file, using foreign key, on delete cascade)
* status (try enum: valid, lost, expired)    
 (out of circulation: if a patron loses his/hers, we can never assign the same barcode to someone else)
* expiry date (this will be set for a year from present or from their last birthday)

All of these fields are required.

## Bib (Bibliographic entry)
* id/key (autogenerated)
* title 
* author

## Holdings (representing actual physical media)
* barcode = key. This will be the same format as the Library Card barcode, but it will begin with a 3
* BIB id# (link)
* Patron id# (if checked out)
* status (link to status list: in, out, lost, discard, repairs, ...)
* cost
* media (link to meia list: book, DVD, audiobook, ..) (?)
* language ?

## Status (status of books)
* code (primary key) varchar(10)    Could this be an enum?
* description (40 chars, varchar)

"code" will be IN, OUT, LOST, DAMAGED, DISCARD, REPAIRS, CR, ...     
"description" provides a description of the code. eg. CR = "Claims Returned"    
There will only be about 5-10 statuses.
